# Super Mario Bros in JavaScript

Based on the [youtube video series](https://www.youtube.com/MethMethMethod) by [Meth Meth Method](https://github.com/meth-meth-method).
This is a Super Mario game in vanilla JavaScript written from scratch.  

My version of the game is deployed at [Heroku](https://xradne.herokuapp.com/).
